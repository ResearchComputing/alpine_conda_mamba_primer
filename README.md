## RC Primer: Installing Software on Alpine with Conda and Mamba


Research software is often complex and difficult to manage, particularly on shared high-performance computing systems like the [Alpine cluster](https://www.colorado.edu/rc/alpine) housed at CU Boulder. [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) is an open-source software and environment management system that makes it easy to install complex software packages and their dependencies. Conda supports multiple languages and is particularly well-suited for managing python and R software environments. In this RC Primer* we will cover using Conda, and its newer, faster relative, [Mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), to create python and R environments on the Alpine cluster.

In order to follow along with the hands-on component of this workshop, youâ€™ll want to have a research computing account. If you need assistance with creating an account, see the [RC Quick Byte - Getting a Research Computing Account](https://github.com/ResearchComputing/Getting_An_Account).

The ability to navigate a Linux environment is useful, but not required for this training. If you would like to develop your understanding of Linux, see the [RC Short Course - Supercomputing Spinup 1: Working with Linux](https://github.com/ResearchComputing/Supercomputing_Spinup/tree/main/linux_bash_spinup).




* _What is an RC Primer?: An RC Primer is a session that provide an introduction to concepts, systems, and tools. You can expect to leave "Primers" with an introductory-level understanding of the topic_.
